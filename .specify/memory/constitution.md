# AI/Spec-Driven Book Creation Constitution

## Core Principles

### Authorial Integrity
The book must reflect a clear, consistent voice and perspective, even when AI-assisted. All content must maintain coherent narrative thread and unified writing style throughout.

### Structural Coherence
Logical flow across chapters, with modular, reusable content architecture. Chapters and sections must interconnect logically while maintaining independence for reference use.

### Reader-First Clarity
Concepts explained accessibly to a technical but non-expert audience (e.g., developers new to AI-native workflows). All explanations must be clear, jargon-free where possible, and include practical examples.

### Open-Source Ethos
All content, code, and assets must be openly licensed and reproducible. Documentation, code samples, and workflows must be accessible to all users without proprietary barriers.

## Content Standards

### Format and Structure
Content format: Markdown (compatible with Docusaurus v3). Documentation structure: Follow Docusaurus best practices (sidebar navigation, metadata, versioning-ready).

### Code Examples
Must be tested, minimal, and annotated; use real commands from Spec-Kit Plus & Claude Code. All code examples must be verified to work in the documented context.

### Writing Style
Professional yet conversational; Flesch-Kincaid grade level 9–11. Language must be inclusive, technically accurate, and engaging for the target audience.

### Licensing and Distribution
Licensing: All content under MIT or Creative Commons BY 4.0. Version control: Every chapter and asset committed with semantic Git messages.

## Development Workflow

### Content Creation Process
All content follows spec-driven development methodology using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code tools. Each chapter or section begins with clear specifications before implementation.

### Quality Assurance
All content, workflows, and CLI snippets must be executable by readers. Every documented process must be tested and verified for reproducibility.

### Deployment Standards
Target deployment: GitHub Pages (via Docusaurus build). No external dependencies that break static site generation. No hardcoded secrets or user-specific paths in published content.

## Governance

All development activities must comply with these constitutional principles. Changes to this constitution require explicit approval and documentation of the reasoning. Development teams must verify compliance with all principles during reviews and merge processes.
