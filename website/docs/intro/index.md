# Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on developing humanoid robots using Physical AI principles. This book provides a hands-on, project-driven approach to building embodied intelligence systems using open-source tools.

## What You'll Learn

In this 13-week course, you'll develop expertise in:

- **ROS 2 Control Systems**: Building robust control architectures for humanoid robots
- **Simulation Environments**: Using Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim for safe development
- **Perception Systems**: Implementing computer vision and sensor fusion with Isaac ROS
- **AI Integration**: Connecting large language models with robotic action planning
- **Vision-Language-Action Pipelines**: Creating intelligent robot behaviors

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:

- AI/ML developers looking to apply their skills to robotics
- Robotics students seeking practical implementation experience
- Engineering educators building embodied intelligence systems
- Researchers exploring Physical AI concepts

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

- Basic programming experience in Python
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Access to a development environment (details in next section)

## Course Structure

The book is organized into 13 weekly modules, each building upon the previous to create a complete humanoid robotics system. Each week includes:

- Theoretical foundations
- Practical implementation
- Hands-on exercises
- Integration with previous modules

## Getting Started

Begin with the [prerequisites](./prerequisites.md) section to ensure your development environment is properly configured, then proceed with the local or cloud setup guides.
